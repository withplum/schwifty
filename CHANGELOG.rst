Changelog
=========

Versions follow `CalVer <http://www.calver.org/>`_ with the scheme ``YY.0M.Micro``.

`2022.02.0` - 2022/02/15
------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* N26 BIC for Spain `@brunovila <https://github.com/brunovila>`_
* Manually curated entries for banks from Iceland `@gautinils <https://github.com/gautinils>`_

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Removed manually curated bank entries for Spain since all values were already part of
  the generated registry.
* Updated bank registry for Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Netherlands and Poland
* Added overwrite for IBAN spec of Czech Republic and France. The branch and account code positions
  are wrongly provided in the official IBAN registry.

`2021.10.2` - 2021/10/12
------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Added 440 additional bank records for Spain.

`2021.10.1` - 2021/10/11
------------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Use `importlib.resources <https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources>`_
  for loading internal registries. This removes the need to have ``setuptools`` installed.
  Thank you `@a-recknagel <https://github.com/a-recknagel>`_ for the idea!

Fixed
~~~~~
* Ensure that Belgian BBAN checksums are always 2 digits long.

`2021.10.0`_ - 2021/10/01
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Added IBAN spec for Sudan (SD).
* Added and extended manually curated bank entries for Turkey, Italy, Israel, Ireland, Spain,
  Switzerland and Denmark `@howorkon <https://github.com/howorkon>`_.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Updated bank registry for Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Netherlands, Poland,
  Slovenia and Slovakia.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Disallow ``schwifty`` to be installed for Python versions older than 3.7. It was unsupported
  before but is now rejected upon installation with an appropriate error message.
* Austrian bank codes are now consistently left padded with zeros. This fixes the mapping from
  IBAN to BIC for the Austrian federal bank institutes.

`2021.06.1`_ - 2021/06/24
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Enable tool based type checking as described in `PEP-0561`_ by adding the ``py.typed`` marker
  `@jmfederico <https://github.com/jmfederico>`_


`2021.06.0`_ - 2021/06/17
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Added bank registry for Swedish Banks `@jmfederico <https://github.com/jmfederico>`_


`2021.05.2`_ - 2021/05/23
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Country specifc checksum validation for Belgian banks, as well as support for generating the
  checksum when using the :meth:`IBAN.generate`-method. `@mhemeryck <https://github.com/mhemeryck>`_

`2021.05.1`_ - 2021/05/20
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* The IBAN validation now optionally includes the verification of the country specific checksum
  within the BBAN. This currently works for German and Italian banks. For German banks the checksum
  algorithm for the account code is chosen by the bank code. Since there are over 150 bank specific
  algorithms in Germany not all of them are implemented at the moment, but the majority of banks
  should be covered.
